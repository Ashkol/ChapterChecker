# ChapterChecker
Chapter Checker allows for downloading and reading of mangas from site https://readms.net It stores data required to download in plain text file called splitdatabase.txt. When downloading it adds downloaded images to a location <location of Executable Jar File> /<Title>/<number of chapter>

To add manga to database:
Comics -> Add comics
Title: Title of manga in database
Author: Author's name in database
Last read: Last read chapter, integral in range from 0 to newest number of chapter on webpage
Path to cover: Path to cover of comics
Webpage address: Address of webpage on readms.net containg list of chapters (see example)
Line beginning: Beginning of line in html file containing image address (see example)

Program works with file in repository.

I advise to change image ratio in download menu to 1,3 and 1,6
